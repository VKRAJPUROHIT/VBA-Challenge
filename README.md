# VBA-Challenge
This is my VBA Homework submission

I have uploaded five(5) VBA scripts in this repository:

The easy solution VBA script with zero rows loops through each worksheet, named 2014, 2015, 2016 and outputs the following information:

*The ticker symbol

*The total volume of the stock

This script works around the zero rows,if any, in the worksheets

The moderate solution VBA script with zero rows loops through each worksheet and outputs the following information:

*The ticker symbol

*Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing closing price at the end of that year

*The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year 

*The total stock volume of the stock

This script works around the zero rows, especially when the open price is zero.The percent change formula requires division by open price and this VBA script comes in handy in such situations

The hard solution VBA script with zero rows gives all the output of moderate solution VBA script plus the following additional information:

*Greatest % increase

*Greatest % decrease

*Greatest total volume 

This script also works around zero values 

The other two scripts for moderate and hard solution have been written after the Excel file was cleaned up of any zero rows. i.e the VBA script assumes there are no zero open price values 

All the VBA scripts run with just a click of a button. You need to click "Run" only once to get the results on all the worksheets 

The results of the VBA analysis for different situations have been uploaded in this repository in the form of snapshots, as the raw excel file was too big to be uploaded in this repository

Thank you
